# Assignment - Maps (The Geographic Kind)

## Objectives

For this assignment, you will:

* Gain experience with graph algorithms.
* Work on a real-world shortest navigation path problem.

## Description

In our final homework assignment of CS62, you will be implementing an algorithm one would find in any navigation app[^1] or GPS device: given an origin and destination, what is the shortest path (or, rather, two shortest paths—terms of both time and distance) between the two? 

[^1]: In practice, Google Maps' navigation algorithm uses a modified version of [A* Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm), which is commonly taught in intro AI classes. 


## Our view of a street map

Real-life street maps, such as those you see online like Google Maps or those displayed by navigation
systems in cars, are a handy way for people to determine an appropriate route to take from one location to
another. They present an abstraction of the world as a scaled-down drawing of the actual streets. In order
to be useful to us, a street map needs to give us the names of streets and freeways, to accurately demonstrate
distances and directions, and to show us where the various streets and freeways intersect.

For our program, we'll need to develop a different abstraction of a street map. Our abstraction must
contain the information that is pertinent to the problem we're trying to solve, presented in a way that will
make it as easy as possible for our program to solve it. Not surprisingly, a picture made up of lines and words
is not an abstraction that is useful to our program; it would require a tremendous amount of effort to design
and implement an algorithm to interpret the lines and words and build up some alternative representation
that's more convenient. It's better that we first design the more convenient representation, then train our
program to read and understand an input file that specifies it. To do so, we'll need to consider the problem
a bit further.

Our program's main job is to discover the shortest distance or driving time between two locations. There's
no reason we couldn't think of locations as being any particular point on a street map (for example, any
valid street address, or even any valid GPS coordinate). For simplicity, though, we'll think of them as points
on the map in which decisions would need to be made, such as:

* The intersection of two or more streets.
* A point of a freeway at which there is an entrance and/or an exit.

Connecting pairs of locations on the map are stretches of road. In order to solve our problem, we'll need
to know two things about each stretch of road:

* Its length, in miles.
* The current speed of traffic traveling on it, in miles per hour.

Our map will consist of any kind of road that a car[^2] can pass over (e.g., streets or freeways), though it will
not make a clear distinction between them. In general, all of these are simply stretches of road that travel
in a single direction. For example, you could think of a simple two-lane street as a sequence of intersections,
connected by stretches of road of equal length running in opposite directions; note, though, that the speed
of traffic on either side of the street might be different. (Stop and think: does this mean an undirected graph or a directed graph would be better?)

In real life, many intersections control traffic using stop signs or traffic lights. Our program will ignore
these controls; we'll instead assume that the traffic speeds on streets have been adjusted appropriately
downward to account for the average time spent waiting at stop signs and lights.

Also, to keep the problem relatively simple, absolute directions (i.e., north, south, east, and west) will
not be considered by our program or reported in its output. For that reason, they won't be included in our
abstraction of a street map, except optionally in the names of locations.

The output of our program will be a trip. A trip is a sequence of visits to locations on the map. For
example, a typical trip around Irvine, CA would look something like this (see the more complete specification
of output later):

* Begin at Peltason & Los Trancos
* Continue to Bison & Peltason
* Continue to Bison & California
* Continue to Bison & 73N on-ramp
* Continue to 73N @ Birch
* Continue to 73N @ 73N-to-55N transition
* Continue to 55N @ Baker
* Continue to 55N Baker/Paularino off-ramp & Baker
* Continue to Baker & Bristol

In addition to the information above, your program will also output information about the distance in
miles and (sometimes) driving time of each of the segments of the trip, as well as the overall distance and
(sometimes) driving time for the whole trip.

[^2]: Though Prof. Li is a proud urbanist and would like to say that maybe we can also think of streets as things people can walk or bike down. 

## Representing our view of a street map

If you consider all of the data that we'll need to represent this abstraction, the task of organizing it
can seem overwhelming. However, there is a well-known data structure that represents this system in a
straightforward way: a directed graph. Using a directed graph, locations on our map can be represented as
vertices, and the stretches of road connecting locations can be represented as edges. (Since traffic travels in
only one direction on a given stretch of road, it makes good sense that the graph should be directed.)
Each vertex in the graph will have a human-readable name for the location it represents. For example,
a vertex might be named `Culver & Harvard`, or it might be named `I-405N @ Jamboree`.

Each edge will be associated with two necessary pieces of information about the stretch of road it
represents: the distance between the two vertices (in miles, stored as a double) and the current speed
of traffic (in miles per hour, also stored as a double).

Since a trip is a sequence of visits to adjacent locations on the map, locations are represented as vertices,
and two locations are adjacent only when there is a stretch of road (i.e., an edge) connecting them, a trip can
be represented as a path in the graph. So our main goal is to implement a kind of shortest path algorithm.

## The program

The goal of your program is to read a file containing a description of all of the locations on a map and
the stretches of road that connect them. It then performs two tasks:

1. Ensures that it is possible for every location to be reached from every other location. If we think of the
locations and roads as a directed graph, that boils down to the problem of determining whether the
graph is strongly connected. If not, the message `Disconnected Map` should be output and the program
should end.
2. Determines, for a sequence of trip requests listed in the input, shortest distances or shortest times
between pairs of locations.

Check out the sample input, which you'll find in the `data` directory in your project directory. A description
of its format follows.

The input is separated into three sections: the locations, the road segments connecting them, and the
trips to be analyzed. Blank lines (and, similarly, lines containing only spaces) should be ignored. Lines
beginning with a `#` character indicate comments and should likewise be ignored. This allows the input to
be formatted and commented, for readability.

The first section of the input defines the names of the map locations. First is a line that specifies the
number of locations. If there are n locations, the next n lines of the input (not counting blank lines or
comments) will contain the names of each location. The locations will be stored in the order read in an
`ArrayList` of `Strings`.

~~~text

~~~

The next section of the input defines the road segments. Each road segment will be an edge in the directed
graph. The first line of this section specifies the number of segments. Following that are the appropriate
number of road segment definitions, with each segment defined on a line with four values on it:

1. The vertex number where the segment begins.
2. The vertex number where the segment ends.
3. The distance covered by the segment, in miles.
4. The current speed of the traffic on the segment, in miles per hour.

Each road segment will be stored in an object from class `Segment`, and the collection of all road segment
will initially be stored in an ArrayList of such objects.

~~~

Finally, the desired trips are defined. Again, the section begins with a line specifying the number of trips.
Following that are an appropriate number of trip requests, with each trip request appearing on a line with
three values on it:

1. The starting location for the trip.
2. The ending location for the trip.
3. `D` if the program should determine the shortest distance, or `T` if the program should determine the
shortest driving time.

Trips will be stored as objects from class `TripRequest`, containing their three defining values, and the
collection of all trips will be stored in an `ArrayList`.

~~~text
# TRIPS

# number of trips to analyze

# the trips

~~~

Your program should read the vertices and edges from the input, build a graph (or multiple graphs),
then process the trip requests in the order that they appear. The output for each trip request is described
later in this write-up.

You may assume that the input will be formatted according to the rules described above, but you may
not assume that the input we'll use to test the program will be identical to the sample. Different numbers of
vertices, different configurations of edges, different names, different distances and speeds, etc., are possible.
The code to read in these values is provided in the class `FileParser`. As well as the constructor, this
class provides methods `getVertices`, `getSegments`, and `getTrips`. There is also the method `makeGraph`:

~~~java
    public EdgeWeightedDigraph makeGraph(boolean isDistance) {
~~~

that returns a weighted directed graph. If `isDistance` is true, the it should return a graph in which the edges represent
distances between location, while if it is false, the edges represent times.

## Implementing your program

Use the `EdgeWeightedDigraph` class to represent your directed graphs. (Why does it make more sense to use
an adjacency list implementation than a matrix-based one for this particular problem?). Make sure you read its code carefully.

The problem we need to solve, that of finding the fastest or shortest trip along a network of roads, is
common in computing. In fact, it's so common that it's already been solved abstractly. Our
problem is an instance of the single-source, positive-weighted, shortest-path problem. In other words, from
one particular vertex (a single source), we'll be finding the shortest path to another vertex, where all of the
edges have a positive weight (in our case, distance or speed, neither of which will ever be negative or zero)
associated with them. We'll use a well-known algorithm called **Dijkstra's Shortest-Path Algorithm** to solve
this problem. You will want to use the version of Dijkstra Algorithm described in class, as it is the simplest
to implement and often the fastest. You will need a priority queue to implement Dijkstra Algorithm. You will be needing a min-priority queue and we have provided such a class, `IndexMinPQ` for your convenience.

Depending on the request, you may be solving a “shortest distance” problem or a “shortest time” problem.
For that, we will build two separate graphs – one for distance and one for time. Note that the input
gives speed data not time! Because you will be optimizing for time, you will need to calculate the time (as
distance divided by speed) in order to use that as the edge cost.

You have been provided with classes `FileParser`, `Segment`, and `TripRequest` and helper data structure classes `Bag`, `DirectedEdge`, `EdgeWeightedDigraph`,  and `IndexMinPQ`.  The constructor for class
`FileParser` converts all the data from parameter `fileName` into a list of vertices (represented as `String`s),
a list of edges (represented as `Segment`s), and a list of trip requests (represented as `TripRequest`s). All
methods of `FileParser` are written for you except for `makeGraph`, whose job is to create a directed graph
based on the input data. Notice that this method takes a boolean parameter `isDistance`, which determines
whether the graph edge costs should be based on distances or times.

There are also a few places in `FileParser` and `TripRequest` where input data should be checked for
validity before using (i.e., don't expect the input to all be error free). You must handle these errors. An
error in the initial graph input (e.g., having an edge with an endpoint that is not a legal vertex) should
result in terminating the program. If a trip request has an error, just skip that request and move onto the
next one.

Most of your work will be in filling out the static methods in class `GraphAlgorithms`. The methods `graphEdgeReversal`,
`breadthFirstSearch`, `isStronglyConnected`, and `dijkstra` have been described in lecture or text. For example with dijkstra, the algorithm should return a map that associates each
vertex in the graph with an arraylist of edges in the shortest path.

The last few algorithms in this class have not been discussed earlier. `getShortestPath` takes a start and
end node and uses the data calculated by dijkstra to return an arraylist of the edges of the shortest path that connects the start and end node. `printShortestPath` prints this information out as described below.

We've provided you with class `testGraphs` in order to provide some simple tests for these algorithms. (Of
course, you should provide more testing to make sure your code is correct. Think `JUnit`!) We will want you
to write the code to solve shortest path problems in the main method of class `Optimizer`. It should take
a run-time parameter which is the full path to the file (in my set-up it is `data/sample.txt`). This method
should read in the input, build the graph(s) and solve the trip requests in the file.

## The output

For each of the trip requests in the input file, your program should output a neatly-formatted report to
the console that includes each leg of the trip with its distance and/or time (as appropriate), and the total
distance and/or time for the trip.

If the trip request asks for the shortest distance, the output might look something like the following.
(These are phony trips, to show you the output format; they are not related to the sample data file provided
above.)

    Shortest distance from Alton & Jamboree to MacArthur & Main
        Begin at Alton & Jamboree
        Continue to Main & Jamboree (1.1 miles)
        Continue to Jamboree & I-405N on ramp (0.3 miles)
        Continue to I-405N @ MacArthur (1.3 miles)
        Continue to MacArthur & I-405N off ramp (0.1 miles)
        Continue to MacArthur & Main (0.2 miles)
    Total distance: 3.0 miles

On the other hand, if the trip request asks for the shortest time, the output might look like this:

    Shortest driving time from Alton & Jamboree to MacArthur & Main
        Begin at Alton & Jamboree
        Continue to Alton & MacArthur (4 mins 48.8 secs)
        Continue to Main & MacArthur (1 min 38.7 secs)
    Total time: 6 mins 27.5 secs

When outputting a time, you should separate it into its components – hours, minutes, and seconds – as
appropriate. Here are some examples:

    32.5 secs
    2 mins 27.8 secs
    13 mins 0.0 secs
    3 hrs 13 mins 12.3 secs
    6 hrs 0 mins 0.0 secs

Don't show hours if there are zero of them. Don't show hours or minutes if there are zero of both of them.
All decimals in seconds should be rounded to a single digit after the decimal point.

The conversion to hours minutes and seconds is a bit tricky. Here is one way to approach it though you
might prefer to find your own way. Suppose timeHours is the double value you are trying to convert:

1. Find the hours (`numHours`) by casting `timeHours` to an `int`. This will truncate to the number of hours.
2. Find the fractional hours (`fractionalHours`)) left by calculating `timeHours - numHours`.
3. (Here is the tricky part:) You could convert this to seconds by multiplying by `60*60 (= 3600)`, but
instead calculate the number of tenths of a seconds left by multiplying by 36000 and then rounding to
the nearest `int`. `int tenthSeconds = (int)Math.round(fractionalHours * 36000)`.
4. Now it is easy to calculate the number of minutes (`minutes`) by dividing by 600 (the number of tenths
of a second in a minute).
5. Calculate `tenthSecondsLeft = tenthSeconds - 600 * minutes`.
6. We bet you'll be able to figure out how to convert this last value to the appropriate number of seconds
(to the nearest 1/10th).

We'll leave it to you to figure out the logic to get the correct units to appear as specified. Notice the last
example in particular, where minutes are shown even if there are 0 of them.

## The provided code

A fair amount of code has been provided already in your project directory, so some of what is described
above is actually already implemented. In particular, you'll find the code to parse the input to make it easier
for you to build the graph. It would be good for you to try to build the code for Dijksta's algorithm on your
own, but if you get stuck, the Java code is in the class Github repo.

## Ethical reflection
In (once again) [Do Abstractions Have Politics?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00786), Kevin Lin writes:


> [Shortest path algorithms] might not take into account
mode of travel, road grade, or ability of the user. It might route
through local roads not designed to sustain large amounts of
traffic safely, increasing risks to the local neighborhood and
other drivers. For pedestrian walking directions, especially at
night, it might not offer the most well-lit or populated route.
To address these problems, we could modify the edge weights
to better match desired outcomes. But even so, the use of
shortest paths algorithms for navigation directions might mask
more structural issues such as public disinvestment municipal
infrastructure and public transit.

In 2023, a man [died after driving off a collapsed bridge](https://www.kcra.com/article/google-maps-man-dies-collapsed-bridge-lawsuit/45247488) that Google Maps had not updated in its database, and was routing him through the path as if the bridge was still there. Similarly, in 2024, three men [died after driving off an unfinished bridge](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/google-maps-navigation-ends-tragically-after-three-men-drive-off-unfinished-bridge-243404.html) while following navigation instructions from Google Maps. 

Say, again, you are an engineer, product manager, or someone higher up with power on the Google Maps routing team.

1. What is your view on the role of being an employee at a tech company in cases where your product results in a user death? Is it feasible to update all closed bridges in real time? Whose (or what) responsibility was it for these deaths? What would you do in this situation to mitigate deaths going forward? 

2. Your friend lives in a relatively wealthy neighborhood that happens to run somewhat parallel to the freeway. When freeway traffic is bad, Google Maps diverts traffic through their neighborhood (shorter time), which has resulted in some children getting injured by drivers who do not slow down, and has "changed the character" of the neighborhood. Your friend has gathered signatures from the majority of the neighborhood residents to stop this diversion through their neighborhood. A) Would you respect this petition? What if hundreds of thousands of such petitions come in? Would you respect it at scale? Would you do something else? B) Say you accept the petition. In a few sentences, describe how you might change this project's implementation to technically accommodate this petition. 

3. As of November 12 2025, Waymo has expanded its self-driving taxi service [to take to freeways](https://waymo.com/blog/2025/11/taking-riders-further-safely-with-freeways). Would you trust riding in a Waymo on the freeway? Why or why not? What if, in a distant but near future, your Waymo gets routed on a collapsed bridge? What would you do in that scenario?
